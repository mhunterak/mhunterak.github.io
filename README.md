This is the resume website for Maxwell Hunter (at gmail dot com)

It also serves as my javascript sketchbook to play around with new ideas. The only rule is to never work on the same project longer than a day - this gives me a deadline to complete the project, and keeps the ideas fresh.

I am currently available for remote work and short/long term projects.
