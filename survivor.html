		After the apocalypse, a lone survivor wanders the ruins, killing monsters and finding food.
		<br/>How long can they survive? Will they be killed by a monster, or starve to death? Only one way to find out...
		<p>
			You can use your arrow keys to control the survivor, or set the threshold for their motivation.
			<br/>This slider is essentially how hungry they need to be to switch from hunting to foraging.
			<br/>if the HP dips below this level, they'll look for food to heal them.
