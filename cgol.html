				<h1>Maxwell's Conway's Game of Life</h1>
				<br/>
			</div>
			<p>
				Conway's Game of Life is a mathematical formua played out on a two dimensional grid. 
				<br/>Each cell is either alive or dead, and is born, survives, or dies based on its neighbors. 
				<p>
					• if a cell is alive, and has less than two living neighbors, it dies from starvation.
				</p>
				<p>
					• if a cell is alive, and has two or three living neighbors, it survives.
				</p>
				<p>
					• if a cell is dead, and has three living neighbors, it is 'born', or becomes alive.
				</p>
				<p>
					• if a cell is alive, and has more than three living neighbors, it dies from overpopulation.

					You can control time, starting, stopping, and changing the speed. You can even more forward one step at a time.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can also create life by clicking on a dead cell, or kill a living cell by clicking on it.
				</p>
				<p>
					A single cell by itself will die, but some patterns survive without changing:

					Some patterns will explode:

				<p>
					Some patterns will spin in place:

					Some patterns will travel a straight line until they hit another pattern:
